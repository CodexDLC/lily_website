This file is a Jinja2 (Mako) template used by Alembic to generate new migration scripts. When you run `alembic revision --autogenerate`, Alembic uses this template to create the Python file for your new migration, pre-filling it with standard boilerplate code.

## Purpose

The template ensures consistency across all migration files by providing a predefined structure, including:
*   Standard imports (e.g., `sqlalchemy`, `alembic.op`).
*   `revision`, `down_revision`, and `branch_labels` variables.
*   `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` functions, which are the core of any migration script.
*   Placeholders for automatically generated DDL (Data Definition Language) operations based on model changes.

## Usage

Developers typically do not edit this file directly. It serves as a blueprint for Alembic to create new migration files in the `versions` directory.
