# 📂 Repositories

[⬅️ Back](../README.md) | [🏠 Docs Root](../../../../../README.md)

This directory contains data repositories, which serve as an abstraction layer between the application's business logic and the data sources. Repositories encapsulate the logic required to access and manipulate data, providing a clean API for the rest of the application.
